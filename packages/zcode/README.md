# @magpie-community/opencode-zcode-auth

Signs in to Z.ai's GLM Coding Plan, or BigModel's (智谱). It does this the
way [ZCode](https://zcode.z.ai) does, and serves the plan's GLM models
over Anthropic's Messages API. Provider id: `zcode`.

## Signing in

- **ZCode: Z.ai GLM Coding Plan** and **ZCode: BigModel (智谱) GLM Coding Plan**
  - zcode.z.ai opens a sign-in flow, and the browser signs in to Z.ai or to
    BigModel. The plugin polls the flow until it is done, so there is
    nothing to paste.
  - With that sign-in it takes the key named `zcode-api-key` from the
    account's default project, or makes it if it isn't there, as ZCode does.
    Requests go to `api.z.ai/api/anthropic` or
    `open.bigmodel.cn/api/anthropic`.
  - If the account has no plan of its own, it looks for a seat on a team's
    plan and uses that team project's `zcode-team-api-key`.
  - Failing both, it uses ZCode's free **Start Plan**, served by zcode.z.ai
    with ZCode's session token.
  - zcode.z.ai serves the Start Plan only to requests that look like the
    ZCode client's own, and refuses others with HTTP 405 "request has been
    blocked due to unusual activity". So a Start Plan request goes as
    ZCode's does: ZCode's headers, ZCode's system prompt ahead of the
    agent's, the day in a `<system-reminder>` turn before the agent's
    turns, and the sign-in's device id in `metadata.user_id`. GLM Coding
    Plan and team requests go as the agent sent them.
  - The Start Plan's token can't be refreshed. When it runs out, sign in
    again.
- **ZCode app's sign-in**
  - Uses the account the ZCode app on this computer is signed in to. For
    every request it reads ZCode's own credentials (`~/.zcode/v2`), so it
    follows ZCode as it signs in again, renews its session or switches to a
    team's plan.
- **GLM Coding Plan API key**
  - Paste a key (`<id>.<secret>`) and say which site it is from.

## Where the sign-in is kept

In OpenCode's `auth.json` (magpie: `plugin-auth.json`), under `zcode`:

- **The browser sign-ins** are kept as an `oauth` entry:
  - `access` is the key.
  - `refresh` is JSON holding the site, the endpoint, the key, ZCode's
    token, the team project, the plan and a device id of this plugin's own.
- **A pasted key** is kept as an `api` entry, with the site in `metadata`.

The plugin never writes ZCode's own credential store. It reads it only for
the ZCode app's sign-in (`refresh` then holds `"source": "zcode"`).

## How requests are routed

Before each request, the plugin checks which plan the account is on, and
asks again every 10 minutes:

- If the key's account has a GLM Coding Plan
  (`/api/biz/subscription/list`), its requests go to that plan. A model
  the account's gift plans also serve is listed again as
  `<model>-Trial`; asking that entry spends the gift (see below).
- Otherwise they go to the gift plans.

Every request carries the key as both `x-api-key` and
`Authorization: Bearer`.

**The gift's trial entries.** An account with a GLM Coding Plan can
also hold gift plans from ZCode activities, ones that expire on a fixed
date. Their allowance would lapse unused if every request went to the
coding plan, so the plugin reads the gift's balance (per the sign-in's
session, kept for 10 minutes) and lists every model a live bucket
serves again as `<model>-Trial`, named in the catalog's spelling
(GLM-5.3-Flash-Trial). Asking a trial entry sends the model to the
gift, dressed as ZCode's own; asking the plain model spends the coding
plan — the choice is the user's. A bucket is judged spent only by its
`remaining_units` — a missing one is unknown, not spent. A trial entry
whose bucket is spent or blocked answers 429 without touching the
coding plan; when the gift answers a trial entry with a quota error
(code 1113 "Insufficient balance or no resource package", code 1005
"exceed quota limit", which it can answer inside an HTTP 200) that too
becomes a 429 and keeps the entry off for a minute. Any other gift
answer (its 405, its 401, its 5xx) goes on as it came: the user picked
the gift, so the coding plan is not spent behind their back. Every 429
counts as spent, Z.ai's 1302/1303 rate limits among them. A stream's
body is never read or buffered on the way.

## The usage card

An account with both plans shows both allowances: the coding plan's
windows first, then the gift's buckets, each with its own name, models
and end. The card's plan and term stay the coding plan's. A gift read
that fails leaves just the coding card — magpie hides a card's windows
behind an error, so a gift hiccup must not black out a working Coding
Plan. A gift that goes out of date while requests use it simply stops
showing.

## Models

The models are the ones ZCode offers for the account's plan. They come
from ZCode's provider config: the release zcode.z.ai names, or an
installed ZCode's copy if that one is newer. The list is kept for 10
minutes. When the config can't be read, the plugin falls back to this list:

| Model | Context | Output | Efforts |
|---|---|---|---|
| GLM-5.3 | 1M | 128K | low, high, max |
| GLM-5.3-Flash | 1M | 128K | low, high, max |
| GLM-5.2 | 1M | 128K | none, high, max |
| GLM-5-Turbo | 200K | 64K | none, high |

The Start Plan has all of these except GLM-5.3.

A gift plan's models appear again as `<model>-Trial` entries, so a
request can spend the gift's quota on purpose. A trial entry is listed
while any live bucket serves its model, spent buckets included (a spent
entry answers 429 rather than vanishing mid-session).
