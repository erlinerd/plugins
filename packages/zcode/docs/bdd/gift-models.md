# ZCode limited-quota model entries

## Goal

Keep the plan's normal model list and existing request behavior. Append distinct
`<original-model>-Trial` entries from live ZCode balance data, including models
absent from the normal plan catalog, named in the catalog's spelling. A trial
entry spends the gift; a plain model always spends the coding plan — the choice
is the user's. Display names and IDs use English. All production changes remain
in the ZCode plugin.

## Verification layers

Use the plugin repository's existing Bun tests for model discovery, quota
metadata and HTTP routing. Check the emitted metadata against the current
Magpie plugin contract. No new UI page or test framework is introduced.

## Scenarios

### Add a real limited-quota model

- Given a coding-plan account has an active grant for a model absent from its plan catalog.
- When the plugin discovers its models.
- Then it includes that model as `<original-model>-Trial` alongside unchanged plan entries.

### Keep grant models discoverable while their quota is exhausted

- Given an active grant has an exhausted bucket.
- When the plugin discovers its models.
- Then its gift entry remains discoverable with the exhausted gift quota applied to that entry.

### Ignore ended grants and unrelated capabilities

- Given a balance includes expired grants or non-model capabilities.
- When the plugin discovers its models.
- Then neither creates gift model entries.

### Restore the upstream model name

- Given a request selects a discovered gift model.
- When the plugin sends the request to the grant endpoint.
- Then the request contains the original model name, without the Trial suffix.

### Keep a gift request within the gift pool

- Given the gift endpoint refuses a request and the coding plan still has credit.
- When the selected model is a gift entry.
- Then the plugin returns the refusal without sending a paid-plan request.

### Reject unavailable gift quota without spending paid credit

- Given the selected gift model is exhausted, unavailable, or temporarily blocked.
- When a request selects that gift entry.
- Then the plugin returns a clear error without sending a paid-plan request.

### Scope quota to the selected pool

- Given the coding-plan week is exhausted and a gift remains available.
- When Magpie evaluates the gift entry's quota metadata.
- Then only the corresponding gift allowance applies to that entry.

### Allow a live sibling bucket

- Given one gift bucket is exhausted and another live bucket serves the same model.
- When the plugin maps gift model quotas.
- Then the exhausted sibling does not make that gift entry appear exhausted.

### Keep plain models on the coding plan

- Given a caller uses an existing model ID without the Trial suffix.
- When the plugin routes the request.
- Then the request spends the coding plan, whatever the gift holds.
